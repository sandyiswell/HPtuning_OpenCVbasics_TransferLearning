# HPtuning_OpenCVbasics_TransferLearning

This repo serves to those beginners/intermediate coders who wishes to learn flawlessly.
The repo covers three high level areas - hyper parameter tuning, basics of OpenCv and Transfer Learning.

Platform and Version
All codes are written in google colab.
tf version = 2.8.0

1) - 1_HP_tuning_NN1.ipynb - In this notebook we will learn how hyperparameter (HP) tuning is done on neural networks.
Initially we will do HP tuning using simple for loop methods.
In later notebooks we will use improved methods for tuning.
